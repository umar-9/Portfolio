                This project intends to show that the monitoring and potential prevention of falls may
                occur with cost-effective technology in a care-home setting. This is done by
                using the BBC micro:bit, where the accelerometer can inform of an
                individual’s current movement, a pulse-oximeter can inform of an individual’s
                heart rate and oxygen levels, a buzzer unit with an astable that can alert the
                user and the staff, and an input and output terminal, which allows staff to see
                the current data and also edit the individual’s boundaries for heart rate and
                oxygen levels and whether they have dementia or not
            </p>
            <p>
                Our product is a wearable monitor for falls, whilst also monitoring pulse rate and blood oxygen levels. 
                The wearable monitor should then output the relevant data to staff, having already processed what is and is not abnormal for that person.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our device uses an accelerometer to detect if a person has fallen over and notify staff after a brief period, allowing
                quick response to the fall, and therefore less injury to the elderly patient. The heart rate monitor helps to notify staff
                when a fall may occur, due to older adults who have suffered from a fall being twice as likely to suffer from an
                irregular heartbeat known as atrial fibrillation, allowing for an even quicker response to falls or injuries. The heart
                rate monitor will also be useful in several other situations involving the health of the elderly person; however, we
                are focusing on it being used to detect and prevent falls. Furthermore, studies show that heart rate can vary by up to
                20% during falls, meaning that the sensors will allow for an even more accurate prediction of when a fall may occur.
                A pulse oximeter sensor is included as well (though not implemented due to compatibility issues), as blood oxygen levels
                can also be a symptom if a patient is about to fall, with hypoxia
                (when a person's blood oxygen level falls below a certain threshold) causing a reduction in physical capabilities, and
                by extension falls which may lead to severe or life-threatening injuries to the elderly patient.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our design also involves a manual override button, allowing the elderly person to easily contact for help if they need
                it, meaning that even if the fall is not detected by any of the sensors, the elderly person still has a way to reach out
                for help. The program that runs on the Micro:bit detects if a person has had a fall (detected by a high acceleration
                followed by a period of rest) and will reset if the person begins moving again. In a care home setting, the program
                would operate on each watch and interface with one receiver Micro:bit which will display the information (in our
                case this is done through the Micro:bit serial and radio communication), this allows for quick communication of
                statistics and therefore a quick response from the care home workers. We have used a 3D printed case for our
                design, enabling for a strong case, whilst also being adaptable to our needs and design, allowing for versatility whilst
                maintaining the function of the device.
            </p>

            <p>
                Based on research conducted, further outlined in the project report, the risk of a fall occurring is 25% times more likely if a person has slept for ≥10% of sleep time with oxygen saturation (SpO₂) of less than 90%.
                Furthermore, heart rate of fallers can have a 20% change, compared to a normal 10% variation, helping to predict if a person will/has fallen. The precise numbers of the range of heart rate are 15 ± 10, which means that a variability of 5-25 bpm would suggest that a fall is likely. 
                The need to measure pulse rate is compounded by the fact that Older adults who suffer a fall are twice as likely to have a common type of irregular heartbeat known as atrial fibrillation
                This meant that pulse rate and oxygen saturation were two vitals that needed close monitoring as potential warning signs of falls.

                The product is able to detect the artificial light coming from your household lighting and provide easy to read data to show when you have been wasting energy (either lights on with no-one in the room or when it’s daytime outside). Filament can be accessed from a web app on any browser, including mobile, which will provide up to date statistics on your total spendings and allow for you to track up to date spendings on household lighting with the help of a Raspberry Pi.
                The essential information such as times when energy has been used on lighting, monthly spendings on energy and equivalent carbon dioxide emissions can be seen from the homepage. Data from individual days can be looked up and trends over a longer period of time can be tracked, allowing you to make better choices about your light usage.
                Our aims were to show that through cost-effective methods, we can ‘accelerate the energy transition’. We chose to do this through targeting household energy wastage from lighting. Therefore, our product has been designed with the target audience of households in mind. This can be seen in the following areas of development: considerations of cost, viability/ease of day-to-day usage, and how well our project would scale. Our product consists of an electronic system for artificial light detection, code to analyse data from both the system and a motion sensor, and code based upon the Django framework to display a website with required data, using a database for storage.
                Household lighting is responsible for about 12% of the 34 EJ of annual household energy consumption, and all 3 of the following problems are addressed: turning off the lights when you leave a room, using energy-efficient LED bulbs – as our product will not function without them or fluorescent bulbs, and using natural light more effectively.
                The intended use of the product is as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Households could install one of these kits with little setup and make considerable savings. The kit would be placed in a room and left to record data.</li>
                <li>Businesses could also make use of these, in order to make more informed financial decisions.</li>
                <li>We have tried to maximise the lighting compatible with the circuit – LED and fluorescent, both of which are likely used by our target audience for their efficiency.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Overall, our project will decrease energy usage for each household. This not only benefits the user, reducing the cost for the energy bill, especially relevant in recent times, and will benefit the environment. Less energy usage means less fuel being burnt (gas primarily in the UK, at around 40%) for that energy being produced, meaning less emissions (carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, etc.), slowing the greenhouse effect, improving air quality, and slowing global warming. The effects of energy usage are also explained to users

                My role in this project was primarily: research (transport, household energy report research, effect of CO₂, and
                suggestions for energy saving – all of which broadened my knowledge about sustainability), initial ideas, circuit
                design & testing/adjusting, the sensor interpretation code, and 3D printing. I was most engaged in the design,
                development, and interaction of the electronic system.
            </p>
            <p>
                The electronic system particularly interested me, as our project needed to distinguish between artificial light (which can be wasted) and natural light (which cannot),
                 therefore, we used a photodiode which has a high-response rate and filtered any signals of under 50Hz out. LED Bulbs flicker at 50Hz and fluorescent bulbs flicker at 100Hz,
                 so we can detect artificial light. Natural light would then be detected using a sunset-sunrise API. As I did designed and built both the electronics and the circuit system, 
                 it was easier than normal to integrate, and I could easily make any adjustments (e.g., having the code look for a square wave instead of a constant logic high/low output).

                In Year 12, I led the student robotics team, where I worked on designing the robot, electronics, and the simulation and competition code (in Python). 
                We reached the quarter finals, were awarded a Gold CREST award and the Concept Design Award (Y12-13) from Chelmsford Science & Engineering Society’s (CSES) Technology Exhibition (TEXPO). 
                Control systems played a crucial role, but the motor encoders used for distance tracking proved unreliable, likely due to issues such as poor connectors, low baud rate, 
                communication latency between the Pi and Arduino, and interrupt data collisions. Despite further testing, we ultimately had to rely on microswitches more heavily and 
                motor current draw to detect when the robot was stuck. Effective communication between sub-teams was essential. For example, I created technical drawings in Fusion 360 to pass to the 
                manufacturing team, acting as an interface between design and production, much like linking two subsystems. In programming, as three programmers worked simultaneously, the importance of 
                clear comments and diverse perspectives was highlighted. This project also underscored the value of Gantt charts to track and communicate task progress, and effective role distribution for efficient use of man-hours.
